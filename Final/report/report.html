<h2>Introduction to the paper "Responsive real-time grass rendering for general 3D scenes"</h2>

The paper "<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3023368.3023380">Responsive real-time grass rendering for general 3D scenes</a>" introduces a grass simulation and rendering solution that can compute and render a large number of grass blades in real-time. The pipeline is designed as follows:

<h3>Grass blade model</h3>

<p>
	The paper first introduces a grass blade model that uses Bezier curves with three control points to represent the shape of the grass blade. 
</p>
<p><img src="./paper_1.png" alt="shader_light" style="width:30%;max-width:600px"></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>v0</strong>: the position of the root, precomputed offline to form a reasonable meadow.</li>
	<li><strong>v2</strong>: the position of the tip, updated every frame by compute shader to represent the physical movement of the grass blade.</li>
	<li><strong>v1</strong>: another control point, controlled by the position of v0 and v2, to form a smooth curve.</li>
</ul>

<p> 
	For the physical simulation, here are some parameters that can be adjusted to control the behavior of the grass blade:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Up vector</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Width</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Height</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Direction (orientation)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Stiffness coefficient</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
	These parameters are packed into 4 <code>vec4</code>s and are used as the input and output of the grass simulation compute shader and the input of the grass rendering vertex shader.
</p>

<h3>Grass Simulation</h3>

<p>
	Every frame, the position of the tip of the grass blade <strong>v2</strong> is updated by a compute shader based on the force contributions from three natural sources:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Gravity (g)</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Recovery (r)</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Wind (w)</strong></li>
	</ul>
	The paper also counts the contribution from collisions with other objects in the scene. For simplicity, I will ignore this part in my implementation.
</p>

<p>
Here is an image to show the contribution of each force to the grass blade:
</p>

<p><img src="./paper_2.png" alt="shader_light" style="width:30%;max-width:600px"></p>

<p>
	After computing the new position of the tip, the compute shader will also validate and correct it to make sure the grass is not under the ground.
</p>

<h3>Culling</h3>

<p>
	To achieve higher compute and rendering performance, the paper introduces a culling process to determine which grass blades are visible to the camera and should be rendered. It includes four steps:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Orientation test</strong>: to cull the blades that are not important for the final rendering, based on occlusions and the orientation of the blade to the camera.</li>
		<li><strong>View-frustum test</strong>: to cull the blades that are not in the camera's view frustum.</li>
		<li><strong>Distance test</strong>: to cull the blades that are too far away from the camera.</li>
		<li><strong>Occlusion test</strong>: to cull the blades that are occluded by other objects in the scene.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	After the culling process, the remaining grass blades are accumulated and sent to the rendering pass to be rendered.
</p>

<h3>Grass Rendering</h3>

<p>
	For grass rendering, the paper used the following pipeline:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Indirect rendering</strong>: to start a draw call using the data stored in a buffer on the GPU. In this way, CPU doesn't need to know the exact number of culled grass blades, and all the data can stay on the GPU without synchronizing with the CPU. This can cut down the CPU-GPU communication overhead.</li>
	<li><strong>Vertex Shader</strong>: each grass blade input is 4 <strong>vec4</strong>s computed in the grass simulation pass.</li>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Control Shader</strong>: to control the tessellation level of each grass blade.</li>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Evaluation Shader</strong>: to evaluate the bezier curve and generate more detailed grass blades geometry based on the data from the compute shader.</li>
	<li><strong>Pixel Shader</strong>: to render the grass blades with a simple shading method.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here is an example result of the paper:
</p>
<p><img src="./paper_3.png" alt="shader_light" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></p>

<p>
	Overall, the paper introduces a complete pipeline to simulate and render grass in real-time. The pipeline is designed to be efficient and scalable to handle a large number of grass blades and it looks good. However, it is implemented in tessellation shader, before the mesh shader pipeline is introduced in the later version of the graphics API. 
</p>

<h2>Introduction to Tessellation Shader Pipeline</h2>
<p>
	The tessellation shader pipeline is a feature introduced in OpenGL 4.0 and DirectX 11 back in 2009. It allows the GPU to generate additional geometry based on the input vertices, which can be used to increase the level of detail of the rendered object. The pipeline consists of three stages:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Control Shader (Hull Shader)</strong>: to control the tessellation level of each patch.</li>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Primitive Generator (Tessellator)</strong>: to generate the tessellated patch based on the tessellation level.</li>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Evaluation Shader (Hull Shader)</strong>: to evaluate the tessellated patch and generate more detailed geometry.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here is a diagram showing the tessellation shader pipeline:
</p>
<p><img src="./intro_tess.png" alt="shader_light" style="width:50%;max-width:600px"></p>

<p>
	The tessellation shader pipeline is widely used in game development to increase the level of detail of the terrain, water, and other complex geometry. It can also be used to implement procedural geometry generation, such as grass rendering, as introduced in the paper. However, the tessellation shader pipeline has some limitations:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Performance</strong>: the tessellation shader pipeline can be performance-intensive, especially when generating a large amount of geometry. </li>
		<li><strong>Complexity</strong>: the tessellation shader pipeline requires additional shaders and stages, which can increase the complexity of the rendering pipeline.</li>
		<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: the tessellation shader pipeline is not supported on all hardware and platforms, which can limit its use in some cases.</li>
		<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: the tessellation shader pipeline is designed for generating additional geometry based on the input vertices, which may not be suitable for all types of geometry generation.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	You can find more about the tessellation shader pipeline in the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Tessellation">OpenGL wiki</a> and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/direct3d-11-advanced-stages-tessellation">Microsoft documentation</a>.

<h2>Introduction to Mesh Shader Pipeline</h2>

<p>
	The mesh shader pipeline is a new feature introduced in Vulkan 1.2 and DirectX 12 Ultimate. It's first introduced by NVIDIA in 2018 with their Turing GPU release, and it became a KHR (cross-vendor) extension in Vulkan in 2022. It allows the GPU to generate and process geometry in a more flexible and efficient way compared to the traditional fixed-function pipeline.
</p>
<p><img src="./Classic Graphics Pipeline.png" alt="Classic Graphics Pipeline" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></p>
<p>
	Looking at the classic graphics pipeline, we can see that basically the pipeline can be divided in two parts by rasterizer. The steps before rasterizer is what we are focusing today, known as geometry processing. It includes:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Input Assembly</strong>: fixed function</li>
		<li><strong>Vertex shader</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Tessellation control shader</strong>: optional</li>
		<li><strong>Tessellator (Tessellation primitive generator)</strong>: fixed function, optional</li>
		<li><strong>Tessellation evaluation shader</strong>: optional</li>
		<li><strong>Geometry shader</strong>: optional</li>
	</ul>

	This fixed sequence have several problems:
	<ul>
		<li>Vertex inputs are annoying to setup for programmers and might be a bottleneck in some applications, because of the fixed function unit implementation on some GPUs</li>
		<li>No control over how geometry is arranged: vertex shaders work at the per-vertex level, so programmer don't generally have control of how geometry is arranged in primitives. We can't control how GPU schedule vertex batch. </li>
		<li>Waste of compute resources and memory bandwidth: You may run several vertex shader invocations that end up forming a primitive that faces back and is not visible and there's no easy way to filter those out, wasting computing power and memory bandwidth reading data for those vertices.</li>
		<li> Geometry amplification and modification can be simpler, faster and more flexible, beyond tessellation shaders and geometry shaders, where the latter is infamous for its inefficiency.</li>
	</ul>
	This is where mesh shaders come in. They are a new type of shader that can be used to replace some of the fixed-function geometry processing stages with a more flexible and efficient compute model. It's more aligned to the modern GPU architecture, where the unified compute units (CUDA Cores, Compute Units, ...) are the main processing units.
</p>

<p><img src="./Mesh Shader Pipeline.png" alt="Mesh Shader Pipeline" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></p>

<p>
	The mesh shader pipeline consists of the following stages:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Task Shader</strong> (optional): to generate tasks (work items) for the mesh shader.</li>
		<li><strong>Mesh Shader</strong>: to process the tasks and generate the geometry.</li>
	</ul>

	What mesh shader basically do is to use a compute shader like model to generate geometry. It can be used to replace the vertex, tessellation, and geometry shaders in the traditional pipeline, providing more flexibility and efficiency in geometry processing. It can also be used to implement procedural geometry generation, such as grass rendering.
</p>

<p>
	You can find more about the mesh shader pipeline in the <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/html/vkspec.html#mesh-shaders">Vulkan specification</a>, the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/DirectX-Specs/d3d/MeshShader.html">DirectX-Specs</a> and the <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introduction-turing-mesh-shaders/">NVIDIA Technical Blog about mesh shader</a> when it is first introduced.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>
	During winter break, I self studied <a href="https://cis565-fall-2023.github.io/"> UPenn's CIS5650 - GPU Programming and Architecture</a> and one of their assignments is to use Vulkan to implement a grass simulation and rendering pipeline based on the paper "<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3023368.3023380">Responsive real-time grass rendering for general 3D scenes</a>". The result is quite impressive, and I learned a lot about the tessellation shader pipeline and grass rendering.
</p>

<p>
	Recently, AMD published a <a href="https://gpuopen.com/learn/mesh_shaders/mesh_shaders-procedural_grass_rendering/">blog post</a> about using mesh shaders to implement the same algorithm on DX12 and HLSL, but they didn't provide a detailed performance comparison between the two methods. As a graphics enthusiast, I am interested in comparing the performance of the two methods and see if mesh shader is a better solution for grass rendering, and if so, where is the bottleneck of the both methods and why. 
</p>
<p>
	Therefore, in this project, I will implement the grass rendering pipeline using both tessellation shader and mesh shader and compare their performance and visual quality. 
</p>

<h2>Implementation & Code</h2>

<p>
	For the implementation, I used the Vulkan infrastructure code from <a href="https://github.com/CIS565-Fall-2023/Project5-Vulkan-Grass-Rendering"> 
	University of Pennsylvania, CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture, Project 5 - Vulkan Grass Rendering</a>. The code is written in C++ and Vulkan, and it provides a basic framework for their assignment. I modified the code to implement the grass simulation and rendering algorithm using tessellation shader pipeline as what the paper did, and then I added the mesh shader pipeline to match the same visual quality of the tessellation shader pipeline. With the same visual quality, I can compare the performance of the two methods.
</p>

<h3> Tessellation Shader Pipeline</h3>

The tessellation shader pipeline is implemented as what the paper did. Every frame, the position of the tip of the grass blade <strong>v2</strong> is updated by a compute shader  <code>compute.comp</code> based on the force contributions from three natural sources:

<ul>
	<li><strong>Gravity (g)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Recovery (r)</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Wind (w)</strong>: I used a perlin noise to simulate the wind force.</li>
</ul>

After validation, the updated grass blades are culled based on the orientation, camera's view frustum and distance, and the remaining grass blades are sent to the tessellation shader pipeline.

<ul>
	<li><strong>Vertex Shader</strong><code>grass.vert</code>: simply multiply the position with a model matrix to transform it to the world space and pass every blade's data (4 <strong>vec4</strong>) to the next stage.</li>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Control Shader</strong><code>grass.tesc</code>: to control the tessellation level of each grass blade. Here I used tessellationLevel = 5, which makes every blades to be tessellated into 6x3=18 vertices and 5x4=20 triangles.
	<p><img src="./grass_blade_shape.png" alt="tessellation" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tessellation Evaluation Shader</strong><code>grass.tese</code>: after the fixed Tessellator stage, the 6x3 quad will be generated and here is where we can evaluate the bezier curve and generate more detailed grass blades geometry based on the data from the compute shader. I used a simple parabola function to generate the grass blade shape. 
		<code>
			float tParabola(float u, float v) {
				return (u * 2 - 1) * (1 - v * v);
			}
		</code>
		<p>
			The vertex's normal and uv is also calculated here and passed to the rasterizer, where they will be interpolated and passed to the pixel shader.
		</p>

	</li>
	<li><strong>Pixel Shader</strong><code>grass.frag</code>: to render the grass blades with a simple shading method, basically just lerp a light green color and darker green color based on the uv. Also the color gets darker to the root.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Here is the result of the tessellation shader pipeline:
	<!-- Tess_1K.mp4 -->

	</video>

	As you can see, the meadow is filled with grass blades that are moving and swaying in the wind. This demo is rendered with 1K grass blades with a really high framerate. After increating the grass blade count to 1M, the framerate drops to around 20fps.

</p>

<h3> Mesh Shader Pipeline</h3>

The mesh shader pipeline is implemented to match the same visual quality of the tessellation shader pipeline. The mesh shader pipeline consists of the following stages. First of all, I setup the mesh shader pipeline in the <code>Renderer.cpp</code> file. To enable mesh shader, I followed the <a href="https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/eedfcc6b74fe9c50025eaceaa8ed70f44b14824a/examples/meshshader/meshshader.cpp#L47">basic mesh shader setup</a> by Sascha Willems and enabled several extensions for the Vulkan Instance and PhysicalDevice. Then a basic mesh shader pipeline is created in <code>CreateGrassMeshShaderPipeline</code>. At the beginning, it would only render three triangles:

<p><img src="./basic_mesh_shader.png" alt="Basic Mesh Shader" style="width:100%;max-width:600px"></p>
<p>
	Then I added the grass blade shape generation in the mesh shader <code>meshshader.mesh</code>. For each thread in mesh shader, I generated the vertices and primitives of 1 grass blade, which is 18 vertices and 20 triangles. The mesh shader is basically a sum of the geometry processing part of the tessellation shader pipeline. It first calculates the actual vertex count and primitive count and uses <code>SetMeshOutputsEXT</code> to set the output vertices and primitives. Then it reads the input data from the compute shader using the index <code>bladeIdx = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x</code> and the data <code>Blade thisBlade = culledBlades.blades[bladeIdx]</code>. The mesh shader then generates the vertices and indices based on the data and the parabola function. The vertex's normal and uv is also calculated here and passed to the rasterizer, where they will be interpolated and passed to the pixel shader. In this example we don't need to pass per-primitive data to pixel shader, but it's possible to do so by using <code>gl_MeshPrimitivesEXT</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Here is the result of the mesh shader pipeline:
	<video controls type="video/mp4" data-fullscreen-container="true" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
		<source src="./Mesh_1K.mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>

	As you can see, the behavior of the grass blades is the same as the tessellation shader pipeline. To verify the visual quality, I used Renderdoc and compared the two methods side by side. It turns out for the same grass blade data, they will generate the exact same geometry with the same visual quality.
	<video controls type="video/mp4" data-fullscreen-container="true" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
		<source src="./comparison.mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>

	In the video, you can see that the two methods generated the same visual quality. This is a proof that my mesh shader implementation is correct and it can match the visual quality of the tessellation shader pipeline.
</p>

<p>
	However, you might notice that the generated vertex layout is different between the two methods. 
</p>

<p>
	<img src="./generated_tess.png" alt="vertex_layout" style="width:50%;max-width:600px"><img src="./generated_mesh.png" alt="vertex_layout" style="width:50%;max-width:600px">

	The left image is the vertex layout generated by the tessellation shader pipeline, and the right image is the vertex layout generated by the mesh shader pipeline. As you can see, the vertex layout generated by the mesh shader pipeline is different from the tessellation shader pipeline. I didn't follow the exact same rule (if there is any) to generate the vertex layout for my mesh shader, so I just choose to generate a more regular grid pattern. This doesn't affect the visual quality of the grass blades, but it might affect the performance of the rendering pipeline.
</p>

<p>
	To quickly test the performance, I also pushed the grass blade count to 1M for mesh shader:
	<video controls type="video/mp4" data-fullscreen-container="true" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
		<source src="./Mesh_1M.mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>

	Noted that the framerate is higher, about 22-24fps, with a ~20% improvement. This is just a first impression to see if mesh shader is more efficient than tessellation shader pipeline, even with the overhead of compute shader and also my screen recording software.
</p>


<h3> One step further: Compute the blade in Mesh Shader Pipeline</h3>

<p>
	To maximize the performance of the mesh shader pipeline, one obvious optimization is to merge the compute shader and mesh shader into one shader. This can reduce the overhead of the compute shader and the data transfer between the compute shader and the mesh shader. 
</p>
<p>
	The setup to merge the compute shader and mesh shader is quite simple, as what I did in <code>meshshader_withcompute.mesh</code> I just need to move the compute shader code to the beginning of the mesh shader and remove the compute shader stage from the pipeline. The mesh shader will now compute the force and apply it to the grass blade, cull the grass blade and use the data to generate the grass blades geometry directly. It would cut 1 read & write from global memory operation for each grass blade, which can be a significant performance improvement on a memory-limited application like this.
	Here is the result of the merged compute shader and mesh shader pipeline:
	<video controls type="video/mp4" data-fullscreen-container="true" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
		<source src="./Mesh_Comp_1M.mp4">
		Your browser does not support the video tag.
	</video>

	The performance improvement is huge, with a framerate of around 55fps, which is more than 2x improvement compared to the tessellation shader pipeline. 
</p>

<h2>Performance Analysis & Comparison</h2>

<p>
	First of all, to compare the performance of the tessellation shader pipeline and the mesh shader pipeline, I measured the frame time of the three setup under different different grass blade counts:

	As you can see, under any grass blade count, the mesh shader pipeline is more efficient than the tessellation shader pipeline. The scaling is getting linear around 2^16 grass blades, and the performance improvement is more significant when the grass blade count is higher. The standalone mesh shader pipeline is even more efficient than the mesh shader pipeline with compute shader, which is near <strong>2.5x</strong> perf improvement (60% time cut) compared to the tessellation shader pipeline.
</p>

<p>
	To figure out why the performance is better for mesh shader, I did a performance analysis of the three methods using Nsight Graphics by NVIDIA.

<h3>Tessellation Shader vs Mesh Shader with Compute Shader</h3>

<p>
	This is the comparison between the tessellation shader pipeline and the mesh shader pipeline with compute shader handling the grass simulation and culling under 1M grass blades. From the unit throughputs subgraph, you can see that tessellation shader has really steep up and downs, marking potentially inefficient scheduling of GPU work. In comparison, the mesh shader pipeline has a more stable throughput, which indicates a more efficient scheduling of GPU work. Some other observations:
	<ul>
		<li>Compute Shader takes a lot of time, which can be eliminated if combined to mesh shader.</li>
		<li>Tessellation shader pipeline didn't use any of L1 cache.</li>
		<li>By only comparing Tessellation Shader pipeline and Mesh Shader Pipeline, Mesh Shader Pipeline has cut 42% of rendering time, which is quite impressive.</li>
	</ul>

	My educated guess on why tessellation shader pipeline is inefficient is because of poor driver scheduling. From the comb like graph of the unit throughputs, it seems that the tessellation shader pipeline is not well scheduled on the GPU, which leads to a lot of idle time and wasted resources. The mesh shader pipeline, on the other hand, has more sustained throughputs graph.
</p>
<h3>Mesh Shader Standalone</h3>
<p>
	Here is the graph of mesh shader pipeline also handling the grass simulation and culling under 1M grass blades:

	This time, one frame only takes <strong>16.99ms</strong>, which compared to 19.61ms + 21.83ms of the tessellation pipeline, is a near <strong>60%</strong> time cut. Even compared to 19.61ms + 12.69ms of the mesh shader pipeline with compute shader, it's still a <strong>47%</strong> time cut. This is because the compute shader is eliminated and the data transfer between compute shader and mesh shader is also eliminated. Although the throughputs and occupancy are lower than the mesh shader pipeline with compute shader, the overall performance is better because of the reduced overhead of the compute shader.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>
	In this project, I implemented the grass simulation and rendering pipeline using both tessellation shader and mesh shader in Vulkan. I compared the performance of the two methods under different grass blade counts and analyzed the performance using Nsight Graphics. The results show that the mesh shader pipeline is more efficient than the tessellation shader pipeline, with a near 60% time cut under 1M grass blades, when combined with the compute shader. 
</p>
	
<p>
	This practice is valuable for me, as I learned:
	<ul>
		<li>how to implement a grass simulation and rendering pipeline using tessellation shader and mesh shader in Vulkan</li>
		<li>how mesh shader pipeline outperforms the tessellation shader pipeline in terms of performance and flexibility (as you can do any computation on it).</li>
		<li>identify where the bottleneck of tessellation shader is using Nsight Graphics</li>
	</ul>
	
	One thing I would like to improve is to not just guessing what's the bottleneck of the tessellation shader pipeline, but to actually find out the reason. I would like to learn more about the GPU architecture and how the driver schedules the GPU work to find out the reason of the comb-like throughput graph of the tessellation shader pipeline.
